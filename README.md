# FINAL_PROJECT
 Final Project. 
 A coop with 2 more students from HAC and a company called Qognify.
 The project was written using NodeJS on the server side and React on the client side.
 The project works with mongoDB and uses rabbitMQ for message transfer.
 Also uses threads, sockets and many more...
 Main purpose of the project is to search for jsons and thumbnails from an already active
 analytics server that uses a unique algorithm from nvidia deapstream infrastructure
 using yolo object detection system.
 Our project is meant to find those objects by filtering them by selecting parameters
 such as colors, cameras , time and display them on the clients application.

*A video explainig how the project works: 
we take some frames from the object in our case the person with the red shirt,
and than we search for him in the app and show the results.
